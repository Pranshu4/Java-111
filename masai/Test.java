//1. JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things
//
//Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
//JRE (to execute your java program).
//
// 
//2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.
//
// 
//
//3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.
//
//
//
//1.JSE–> Java Standard Edition–> You can develop standalone applications/desktop applications or even write scripts using Selenium tool for Automation Testing.
//2.JEE–> Java Enterprise Edition–> It’s used to develop rich enterprise web applications.
//3.JME–> Java Micro Edition–> Can be used to develop applications running on mobile devices, embedded systems etc.
//4.JDK, more specifically, JSE; contains JRE plus the java compiler and other development tools.
//
//5.JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – It’s a package which contains JVM plus supporting files.
//
//6.JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – It acts as an interpreter. It understands byte codes and converts it into CPU understandable instructions.
//
//
//1.Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine. The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent. The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different platforms.
//
//
//2.Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++. Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).
